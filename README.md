# habitica-google-scripts
A collection of scripts used for the online habit tracking tool, Habitica.

Habitica (https://habitica.com/) is an online and mobile application for tracking and managing habits.  It is done in a way that gameifies the building of good habbits and removal of bad habbits.

Habitica has a public API that allows players to automate some of the activities surounding the game/application.  This is my collection of scripts that are run on the Goolge App Scripts platform.

I create one Google Apps Scripts "Project" that I called "Habitica" and dumote all my scripts I use for habitica into there.  Some of the scripts are purely my own created; others, are borowwed from other writers.  The AutoQuest.gs for example it one borrowed.  It is the only one deployed as a web app and uses the Habitica web hook method to recieve realtime events about quest invites and completions.
